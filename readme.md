##Cats From Space
A web and iOS mobile application that allows users to explore satellite imagery and tag interesting objects and phenomena. We hope to crowdsource the discovery of near real-time events on Earth, in addition to a fun social sharing aspect ("Does this look like a cat from space? Yes, yes it does.").
